Dust Mother does not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal information. Dust Mother will only ever access files stored in your Project Wingman save folder and does not access any of your personal information outside of that folder.

The application is open-source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/agc93/dust-mother) if you'd like to see what Dust Mother does and how.

Note that your usage of the Microsoft Store is subject to any applicable terms and conditions, and this is largely out of my hands.
